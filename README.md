# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

In this project, my primary objective was to design a robust system for managing a school’s course database. This task required a deep understanding of data structures and their applications. I embarked on a journey to analyze three distinct data structures: Vectors, Hash Tables, and Binary Search Trees.

Each of these data structures has its unique characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. Vectors are dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink in size, offering efficient access to elements. Hash Tables, on the other hand, provide fast insertion, deletion, and access operations through a unique key. Binary Search Trees (BSTs) maintain their elements in a sorted manner, enabling efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

After a thorough examination of these data structures and their potential use cases within the program, I concluded that a Binary Search Tree would be the most performant data structure for this specific application. The decision was based on the BST’s ability to maintain order and perform operations efficiently, which was crucial for managing the course database.

To further understand the implementation of these data structures, I created pseudocode for each one. This exercise allowed me to visualize how I would tackle the problem using each data structure. Understanding data structures is vital because they all have their strengths and weaknesses. Knowing when to use one over the other can lead to more performant code and prevent future headaches from using an inappropriate data structure for a task.

During this project, I found that visualizing how binary search tree algorithms work and coding them could be challenging. To overcome this, I found it helpful to draw them out on a sheet of paper. This practice allowed me to see what I was doing when writing the algorithms, making the process more tangible and understandable.

This project underscored the importance of proper planning before starting to code. Thoughtful consideration of the algorithms, data structures, and overall flow of the program leads to a better overall product. It not only enhances the performance of the program but also makes the development process smoother.

One of the significant learnings from this project was the practical application of Binary Search Trees. Having implemented it once, I feel confident that I could adapt this structure to other programs with minor modifications. Creating the pseudocode for this project also made commenting easier because it essentially served as comments, providing a clear roadmap for the actual coding process.

In conclusion, this project was a valuable learning experience that reinforced the importance of choosing the right data structures, planning, and visualization in programming. It has equipped me with the knowledge and confidence to tackle similar problems in the future. I look forward to applying these learnings in my future projects.
